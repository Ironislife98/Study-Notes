# Unit 2

## Trench Warfare: Barrle O' The Marine
- The result of the failure of the ``Schlieffen Plan`` in *Sept of 1914* => the attacking German Army led by ``Helmuth won Matke`` met the retreating French forces @ the ``Marne River`` (30 miles east of Paris)
- Both armies attempted to outflank the enemy

### Problem
- Armies were too closely engaged; could easily predict what the other would do.
- Parisian garrisars transported troops to the front in taxi cabs!

### Leads to... 'Race to the Sea'
- Established of the Trench System from Central France to Northern Belgium
- Would ultimately lead to the "bagging down" on the Western Front resulting in stalemate. 

### Summary
As a consequence of the Schlieffen Plan, both armies met at the Marne River. Unfortuately they were too closely engaged and predicted what the other would do, leading to stalemate.

## The Guns of August
- **Germany offered Austra Hungary a "Blank Cheque" to declare war on serbia and Russia.**

### Timeline
- Germany declares war on Russia
- Germany declares war on France
- Germany invades Belgium
- Schiffen Plan is put into execution **"Keep the Right Wing Strong"**
- Britian declares war on Germany in defense of Belgium

## Propaganda
### What?
- A method used by a government to persuade its citizens to do certain thngs.
- Progaganda was widely caused by all the countries involved in World War 1.

### How? 
- Propaganda had numerous purposes during the war, but the prominent way was to boost ``Troop Recruitment`` => after 1915, the "professional" armies from all the major countries involved (France, Germany, and Britian) were dead.
- As the war progressed, raising funds from the homeland became a top priority => ``Victory Bonds`` in Britian were encouraged to invest in the war effort to build tanks, ammunition and general weaponry.
- Soldiers and the general public were also strongly subjected to censorship => this controlled the informatiom the public recieced about the war.

### Psyops
- Unlike traditional uses of propaganda, World War 1 introduced the use of guilt and ``demonizing`` the enemy => able bodied men were often ridiculed for "cowardly" behaviour for not joining the war effort. 

## Canadians in the Battle: YPRÃ‰S 1915
- The first in a series of battles fought to liberate Flanders from German Control
- In *February 1915*, the Germans introduced ``chlorine gas`` to the battlefield
    - Result => Use of chemicals caused your skin to bubble and your lungs to bleed (long, drawn-out excruciating death)
- Chemical wepons were outlawed by the ``Geneva Conference in 1928`` (Not adhered to..see Hiroshima)

## Somme 1916
- Introduction of the ``Vickes' Machine Gun`` totally changed the faece of the battle in the 20<sup>th</sup> century => capable of firing 400 bullets per minute
- Because of this excellent defense weapon, the Somme became a battle of ``attrition`` => victory of a high cost of life (millions for both sides).
- Battle plan proposed by Allied Commander ``Douglas Haig``, also known as "the butcher of the Somme" => two weeks of artillery bombardment followed by a massive "over the top" attack on the 1<sup>st</sup> of uly (some dead in the 1<sup>st</sup> hour).
- Was a classic example of attack and counter attack => why? Because of the German policy of recapturing all lost territory.
- Result was 1.5 million fatalities over a six month period including 400,00 Brits and 400, 000 Germans.

## The Air War
### The Airplane
- The first successful flight was recorded by the ``Wright Brothers`` in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina (1903).
- During the early stages of the war, the airplane was used primarily for ``reconissance`` (spying on the enemy).

### Change
- Pilots began to smuggle aboard pistols, rifles, light machine guns, and even bricks!
- Lead to the development of the ``German Fokker Airplane`` => mounted machine guns that could fire straight ahead without hitting the propeller blades.

### The Ace
- Term for a pilot who had shot down 5 enemy aircraft.
- Being a pilot was by far the most dangerous job in the war => average survival rate was 2 weeks.
- As a result, pilots recieved "perks".
    - Clean beds
    - Good food
    - Brandy + Champagne
- Pilots engaged in "dog fights" with one another.
- Famous confrontation => Billy Bishop (Canadian) vs Manfred von Richthofen.

### Summary
- Pilots would use machine guns and pistols to fight in the air.
- Pilots would enjoy many luxuries because they lived for such a short time.
- German Fokker Airplane was tied to the stroke of engine to bullets wouldn't hit propeller blades.
- Aces were people who had shot down 5 enemy planes, very famous.

## War at Sea
### Battle of Jutland (1916)
- Took place off the coast of Denmark in the North Sea on 31<sup>st</sup> of May.
- Served as evidence to the Germans that they could not win a naval war usuing Drednaughts in the long run.
- **Germans would use submarines for the rest of the war.**

### The U-Boat
- From the German word ``Unterseeboot``, ("undersea boat").
- It sunk British Dreadnaughts from below water.
- British had to create a convoy system.

#### Convoy System
- Naval techniques in which supply ships travlled with battleships and destroyers for protection.

### The Strategy
- Control of the seas.
- By deploying a blockade you could cut the enemy off from recieving vital food and supplies.

## Enemy Aliens
- Over 8,597 enemy aliens were held in labour camps during World War 1. The majority were Ukranians.
- Tarred and feathered germans, as well as had police check in on them.
- Due to mounting suspicion of loyalty to Germany instead of Britian, Berlin, Ontario changed their name to Kitchener, after British War Minister.

## Vimy Battle
- Occured between the 8<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup> of April, 1917.
- The offensive was launched as a Canadian attempt to take the ridge from German control.
- The ridge had served as a vital defense posiiton for the Germans since the invasion of France in 1914.
- The ridge sat atop the Hindenburg Line.
- Changes in tactics and strategy were the keys to Vimy's success
    - Unlike the French and British who had failed, Vimy proved as an example where "doing your homework" pays off.
### Currie: The Maestro
- After witnessing the atrocities @ Verwin in 1916, Aurthur Currie's tactics @ Vimy in 1917 focused on Reconnaissance and individual platoon awareness.
- Instead of reverting back to heavy artillery bombardments followed by a heavy frontal assault, Currie employed a ``Rolling Barage``.
- Rolling or "creeping" barage proved to be very effective but also very dangerous.
    - Unlike traditional World War 1 tactics, this relied on troops advancing as the artillery bombardment took place.
    - RESULT => massive success; canadians took Hill 145 and "The Pimple" on the morning of April 12 (Easter Sunday) leaving the rest of France open for breakthroughs.

## From Russia With Love
### The Eastern Front
- When war broke out in 1914, like their allies Britain and France in teh west, Russia mobilized for war in the east => however, unlike their Entente allies, the Russians were not a professional army.
- The Russian army was a peasant army, meaning it was calleed upon only in times of war. 
    - This was reflected in the fact that many Russian soldiers went to the front ill-eqquiped and trained. Some when to the front with pitch forks and axes!
- As a result, Russia faced many early defeats @ **Tannenberg** and **Maserian Lakes** that were ``Attritional`` in nature. For example, 170,000 vs 12,000 Germans.

### Revolution!
- As the war continued, Russia's performance proved to be woeful.
- Mass munities and desertions from the army leading to a general condition of lawlessness.
- Mass riots erupted in the cities calling for "peace, bread, and land" which forced the abdication of ``Tsar Nicholas II`` in March of 1917.
- The Romanoff dynasty was replaced with a provisional government that was eventually replaced by the ``Bolsheviks`` under the leadership of Vladamir Lenin. He would quickly implement the politcal theory of ``communism``, fighting for the needs of the proleratiat "working class".
- Lenin signed the ``Treaty of Brest-Litovsk`` in March of 1918 formally ending Russia's participation in the war.

## The Final Days of WW1
USA IN, RUSSIA OUT

### 1917
- Ironically the success of the German U-Boat campaign brought about the entrance of the USA because of the sinking of the American passenger ship ``Lisitanian`` in 1914.
- This, coupled with the Belshevik Revolution in Russia in Octover of 1917, meant this was a year of significant change.
- In Canada, Robert Borden's ``coalition`` government passed a ``conscription`` law forcing all able bodied males over the age of 18 to enter the armed forces.
- As a result, **Balance of Power** dramatically shifted in favour of the allies.

## The War Ends - Passchendale
- Heavy Rains and artillery bombardments turned the battlefront and landscape into a ``Quagmire``.
- Currie warned Haig about the consequences of an offensive in such conditions, but Haig didn't listen.
- RESULT => Canadians took the ridge but @ an extremely high cost; 16,000 casualties out of 20,000.

## Canada's 100 Days
- Passchendale was the first instance in the war where Canadian troops were led by a Canadian general.
- With the entrance of the Americans in 1917, the Germans made one final offensive push in the spring of 1918 @ ``Cambrai``.
- After their tank offensive failed to take Paris, Canadians pushed into Belgium => the Canadian corps won an important battle @ Mons but again at a high cost of life; 48,000 casualties, including 9,000 dead.
- RESULT => Did force the Germans to sue for peace and an Armstice was arranged for **11AM Nov<sup>th</sup> 1918**.

## Treaty of Versailles
### Aftermath
- When the armstice was signed in 1918 between Germany and the allies, Europe was in a state of disarray.
- Northern Frnace and Belgium were nearly completely destroyed.
- RESULT => Revenge! As the victors of the war, France and others wanted compensation to rebuild their devastated cities, towns, and countryside.
- Britain also had promised returning veterans for making the ultimate sacrifice during the Great War.

### Paris: 1919
- Starting in Jan 1919, the ``Big Four`` began mettings in Paris to decide the fate of WW1.
- Included Britian PM David Loyd george, French president George Clemenceau, American president Woodrow Wilson, and Italian PM Vito Orlando.
- MAJOR EXCLUSIONS => Germany and her allies, plus the Soviet Union.
- All allies came with their own agenda => Wilson came with his famous "14 points", to make the Great War truely "the war to end all wars".
- Europeans however only had revenge on their minds, CLAUSE 231.
