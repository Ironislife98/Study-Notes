# Unit 2

## Trench Warfare: Barrle O' The Marine
- The result of the failure of the ``Schlieffen Plan`` in *Sept of 1914* => the attacking German Army led by ``Helmuth won Matke`` met the retreating French forces @ the ``Marne River`` (30 miles east of Paris)
- Both armies attempted to outflank the enemy

### Problem
- Armies were too closely engaged; could easily predict what the other would do.
- Parisian garrisars transported troops to the front in taxi cabs!

### Leads to... 'Race to the Sea'
- Established of the Trench System from Central France to Northern Belgium
- Would ultimately lead to the "bagging down" on the Western Front resulting in stalemate. 

### Summary
As a consequence of the Schlieffen Plan, both armies met at the Marne River. Unfortuately they were too closely engaged and predicted what the other would do, leading to stalemate.
