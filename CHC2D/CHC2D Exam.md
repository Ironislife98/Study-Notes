### 9. Describe the relationship between Canada and the US near the beginning of the 20th century and give a detailed account of the Alaska Boundary Dispute.

The relationship was tense. In the Alaska boundary dispute, Canada and the United states were fighting over land claims in Klondike and surrounding areas. Gold was found in this region and everyone wanted it. Also, both countries wanted access to the Lynn Canal, which would be needed to trade with thousands of miners.

Canada was given a huge advantage at the tribunal. America with 3 votes, Canada with 2 votes, and Britain with 1 vote, a split vote would go to Canada because of our involvement in the Boer war and Canada was a colony. President Theodore Roosevelt and his bullying diplomacy ("speak softly and carry a big stick") got Britain to side with the Americans.
