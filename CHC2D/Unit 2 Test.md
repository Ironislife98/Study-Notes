# Unit 2

## Trench Warfare: Barrle O' The Marine
- The result of the failure of the ``Schlieffen Plan`` in *Sept of 1914* => the attacking German Army led by ``Helmuth won Matke`` met the retreating French forces @ the ``Marne River`` (30 miles east of Paris)
- Both armies attempted to outflank the enemy

### Problem
- Armies were too closely engaged; could easily predict what the other would do.
- Parisian garrisars transported troops to the front in taxi cabs!

### Leads to... 'Race to the Sea'
- Established of the Trench System from Central France to Northern Belgium
- Would ultimately lead to the "bagging down" on the Western Front resulting in stalemate. 

### Summary
As a consequence of the Schlieffen Plan, both armies met at the Marne River. Unfortuately they were too closely engaged and predicted what the other would do, leading to stalemate.

## The Guns of August
- **Germany offered Austra Hungary a "Blank Cheque" to declare war on serbia and Russia.**

### Timeline
- Germany declares war on Russia
- Germany declares war on France
- Germany invades Belgium
- Schiffen Plan is put into execution **"Keep the Right WIng Strong"**
- Britian declares war on Germany in defense of Belgium

## Propaganda
### What?
- A method used by a government to persuade its citizens to do certain thngs.
- Progaganda was widely caused by all the countries involved in World War 1.

### How? 
- Propaganda had numerous purposes during the war, but the prominent way was to boost ``Troop Recruitment`` => after 1915, the "professional" armies from all the major countries involved (France, Germany, and Britian) were dead.
- As the war progressed, raising funds from the homeland became a top priority => ``Victory Bonds`` in Britian were encouraged to invest in the war effort to build tanks, ammunition and general weaponry.
