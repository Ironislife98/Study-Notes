# Unit 2

## Trench Warfare: Barrle O' The Marine
- The result of the failure of the ``Schlieffen Plan`` in *Sept of 1914* => the attacking German Army led by ``Helmuth won Matke`` met the retreating French forces @ the ``Marne River`` (30 miles east of Paris)
- Both armies attempted to outflank the enemy

### Problem
- Armies were too closely engaged; could easily predict what the other would do.
- Parisian garrisars transported troops to the front in taxi cabs!

### Leads to... 'Race to the Sea'
- Established of the Trench System from Central France to Northern Belgium
- Would ultimately lead to the "bagging down" on the Western Front resulting in stalemate. 

### Summary
As a consequence of the Schlieffen Plan, both armies met at the Marne River. Unfortuately they were too closely engaged and predicted what the other would do, leading to stalemate.

## The Guns of August
- **Germany offered Austra Hungary a "Blank Cheque" to declare war on serbia and Russia.**

### Timeline
- Germany declares war on Russia
- Germany declares war on France
- Germany invades Belgium
- Schiffen Plan is put into execution **"Keep the Right Wing Strong"**
- Britian declares war on Germany in defense of Belgium

## Propaganda
### What?
- A method used by a government to persuade its citizens to do certain thngs.
- Progaganda was widely caused by all the countries involved in World War 1.

### How? 
- Propaganda had numerous purposes during the war, but the prominent way was to boost ``Troop Recruitment`` => after 1915, the "professional" armies from all the major countries involved (France, Germany, and Britian) were dead.
- As the war progressed, raising funds from the homeland became a top priority => ``Victory Bonds`` in Britian were encouraged to invest in the war effort to build tanks, ammunition and general weaponry.
- Soldiers and the general public were also strongly subjected to censorship => this controlled the informatiom the public recieced about the war.

### Psyops
- Unlike traditional uses of propaganda, World War 1 introduced the use of guilt and ``demonizing`` the enemy => able bodied men were often ridiculed for "cowardly" behaviour for not joining the war effort. 

## Canadians in the Battle: YPRÃ‰S 1915
- The first in a series of battles fought to liberate Flanders from German COntrol
- In *February 1915*, the Germans introduced ``chlorine gas`` to the battlefield
    - Result => Use of chemicals caused your skin to bubble and your lungs to bleed (long, drawn-out excruciating death)
- Chemical wepons were outlawed by the ``Geneva Conference in 1928`` (Not adhered to..see Hiroshima)

## Somme 1916
- Introduction of the ``Vickes' Machine Gun`` totally changed the faece of the battle in the 20<sup>th</sup> century => capable of firing 400 bullets per minute
- Because of this excellent defense weapon, the Somme became a battle of ``attrition`` => victory of a high cost of life (millions for both sides).
- Battle plan proposed by Allied COmmander ``Douglas Hag``, also known as "the butcher of the Somme" => two weeks of artillery bombardment followed by a massive "over the top" attack on the 1<sup>st</sup> of uly (some dead in the 1<sup>st</sup> hour).
- Was a classic example of attack and counter attack => why? Because of the German policy of recapturing all lost territory.
- Resul was 1.5 million fatalities over a six month period including 400,00 Brits and 400, 000 Germans.
